# AI_B_Project_Updated
An updated version of "AI_B_From_Then_to_Now-_Project" - due to spelling errors
The main file, the notebook, is "NoteBook_From_Then_to_Now- Holiday_ in_CoÌ‚te_d'Azur.ipynb" The notebook explains the process of creating a digital storybook with two separate timelines, using a travel diary from the Univerity of Glasgow's special collections as a primary source. There are additional media files which are organised in the respiritory There are no additional libraries needed to view the notebook.

A big thank you goes to Robert McLean for transcribing the diary and making this transcript available to the class I'd also like to extend my gratitude to my peer support group who were extremely valuable, offering feedback and testing the product, and splitting the costs of ChatGPT-4.
